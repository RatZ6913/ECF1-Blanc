HTML & CSS & Javascript 

Subject of the Project : Pokedex

Goal : Learning to use Fetch() , with Async Function and Await Response.


Our referent trainer gave us an exercise to do. It is to know how to use the API, to be able to make a pokÃ©dex. Learn how to browse objects in a text in Json format. And then to display them in our HTML page. It was a good training, and I'm glad to have been able to realize this project alone. Well at the end, my head exploded... ðŸ¤•. But sastisfied with myself.
